Abstract
The rapid advancement of chat-based language models has led to remarkable
progress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on human
input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming.
This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents, and provides insight into
their “cognitive” processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous
cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named roleplaying . Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents
toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We
showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying
the behaviors and capabilities of a society of agents, providing a valuable resource
for investigating conversational language models. In particular, we conduct comprehensive studies on instruction-following cooperation in multi-agent settings.
Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework,
offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on
communicative agents and beyond: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.
1 Introduction
“What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence
stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle.”
- Marvin Minsky, The Society of Mind, p. 308
Confronted with the complexities of real-world tasks, solving them often requires multiple steps.
The rapid progress of chat-based large-scale language models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable
achievements in complex task-solving [82, 84, 116, 89, 5, 10, 122, 13]. Nevertheless, it is worth
noting that their success is heavily reliant on human input to guide the conversation in the right
direction. This reliance necessitates users to provide relevant and precise prompts based on their
intentions and the chat agent’s feedback. This can be challenging, time-consuming, and sometimes
impossible. Crafting effective prompts often demands a deep understanding and expertise of a
particular domain of knowledge. Consider an individual who lacks trading expertise; they would find
it difficult to create suitable prompts for directing a chat agent to develop a trading application. This
predicament is raising a crucial question: can we replace human intervention with an autonomous
communicative agent capable of steering the conversation toward task completion with minimal
human supervision? To tackle this issue, it is crucial to conduct more research exploring the potential,

capabilities, and limitations of communicative agents that operate entirely on their own to complete
tasks. Understanding how multiple agents interact with each other is important for anticipating the
future of artificial intelligence. The dynamics of collaborating or competing agents play a key role in
determining the success of AI systems [6, 26, 27, 84, 99, 9, 10].
This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation
among communicative agents and provide insight into their “cognitive” processes. Several challenges
arise when asking a society of agents to autonomously cooperate on completing tasks. Examples we
encountered in our preliminary analysis include role flipping, assistant repeating instructions, flake
replies, and infinite loop of messages. Therefore, it is critical to investigate ways to align these models
with human intentions and to explore means enabling their effective cooperation. To address these
issues, we propose a novel cooperative agent framework named role-playing to automate cooperation
between communicative agents. Specifically, our proposed approach involves using role-playing with
inception prompting to autonomously guide the communicative agents toward task completion. Only
a preliminary idea is needed from human to guide the conversations toward complex task-solving.
Our library, which we make publicly available, provides modular functionality, and includes implementations of different agents, examples of well-crafted prompts, and data explorers. We hope our
library serves as a ground for future research in various areas such as multi-agent systems, cooperative
AI, game theory simulations, social analysis, AI ethics, AI alignment, and beyond.
In addition, our role-playing method provides a highly scalable way to generate conversational
data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents. We showcase how role-playing
can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task completion and record their
conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. In particular, we consider two
cooperative scenarios of role-playing and generate two large conversational, task-oriented, and
instruction-following datasets: AI Society and Code. We also use our framework to collect two singleturn question-answer datasets, Math and Science, for LLM ability emergence study. Furthermore,
we generate a Misalignment dataset that is a simulation of possible malicious applications which
demonstrate the potential risks of an unaligned autonomous agent system. The datasets offer a
valuable resource for investigating conversational language models, enabling them to comprehend
and react to human language more effectively. Furthermore, our role-playing offers a scalable
method of creating conversational instruction-following data, which can potentially enhance the
development of more advanced language models. We show that solutions derived from our roleplaying framework outperform those generated in a single shot by gpt-3.5-turbo [82] in both
GPT4 and human evaluations. We also study knowledge emergence in LLMs by fine-tuning LLaMA
[117] on progressively growing datasets generated through our framework. Additionally, we evaluate
our code generation capabilities through benchmarking our final model on HumanEval [18] and
HumanEval+ [69].
Contributions. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We introduce a novel cooperative agent framework,
role-playing , that allows communicative agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing
tasks while requiring minimal human intervention; (2) Our framework offers a scalable approach
for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems. It illuminates the
challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, and provides strategies for addressing them. We
showcase the potential power of multi-agent collaboration for complex-task solving; (3) We demonstrate the significant emergence of LLM training abilities by utilizing the datasets we have collected
from simulating four distinct agent collaboration scenarios; (4) We have open-sourced our library,
containing implementations of various agents, data generation pipelines, data analysis tools, and
collected datasets, to support research on communicative agents and beyond.
2 Related Work
Communicative Agents. Communication between agents has been studied for a long time [76,
77]. There are many ways to facilitate communication between agents, and with agents [29, 90,
97]. Among these, natural language is considered the most natural form of communication [97].
By enabling agents to function as communicators themselves, they become capable of solving
complex tasks [113, 85, 72, 3, 30, 111, 79, 41, 28, 102, 80, 106, 35, 49, 2, 51, 1, 55, 50, 65, 92].
Communication between AI agents can occur in a competitive setting [115, 108] or a cooperative
setting [40, 27, 11, 137, 70]. Cooperative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed
to work together with humans and other AI systems to achieve common goals [24, 125]. Cooperative
AI systems take into account the needs and capabilities of other agents in the system and actively seek
to collaborate and coordinate their actions with them, which has many potential benefits, including
2
increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and the ability to tackle complex problems that are
beyond the reach of any single agent. However, designing effective cooperative AI systems is still an
active area of research, as it requires addressing a range of technical, ethical, and social challenges
[27]. Our work enables communicative agents to engage in a conversation and cooperate with each
other to solve assigned tasks. The agents, each assigned a distinct role, are expected to apply their
expertise and knowledge to solve their common task.
Instructional LLMs and Prompt Engineering. LLMs are trained on diverse text data and excel
in text completion, with various downstream NLP applications [12, 22, 47, 131, 117]. However,
InstructGPT suggests that LLMs may not align with user intent, proposing reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) [23] and Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) [121] to improve LLMs’
relevance and appropriateness to user instructions. Special types of instruction or prompting methods
, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [123], zero-shot-CoT [61], and ReAct [126], have recently been
developed to enhance the performance of LLMs on reasoning, arithmetic and decision making
tasks [134, 118, 52, 73, 31, 103, 43, 64, 132, 46, 133, 105, 128, 25, 81, 109]. These techniques
underpin the impressive capabilities of recent dialogue LLMs [106, 116, 36, 9, 82, 13], which
aim to simulate human-like conversations and provide personalized and interactive experiences for
users, exhibiting the behavior of conversational AI agents [33]. However, generating instruction
datasets is a crucial challenge in building instruct-based LLMs, with existing datasets ranging
from crowdsourced to generated. Hand-crafted instruction instances are available in [120], while
leveraging previously crowdsourced NLP datasets is a less labor-intensive curation approach [121,
71, 78, 53]. LLMs have been explored for data generation in [101, 63, 68, 114], and Self-Instruct
[119] proposes a semi-automated process for instruction instance generation. Unnatural-Instruction
[48] collects instruction instances by prompting a language model with only three seed examples and
paraphrasing the generated instances to expand the dataset. There is also a large chunk of work that has
proposed methods for automatic dataset creation [67, 57, 19, 75, 20, 98, 59, 96, 129, 62, 130, 86, 8].
Another important challenge is prompt engineering. The quality of the prompt used to guide LLMs
significantly affects its performance [91, 12, 66]. While LMs pre-trained on large data can implicitly
learn tasks with few-shot prompting, hand-crafted prompts may not always suffice. Automated
prompt generation methods have been proposed, such as gradient-guided search [104], mining-based
and paraphrasing-based techniques [54], a meta-prompt [93], and automatic instruction selection and
generation [136]. In this work, we introduce a conversational LLM auto-prompting method called
Inception Prompting, which enables agents to prompt each other to solve tasks through Role-Playing.
The AI user continuously provides instructions to the AI assistant for task-solving. This enables us to
save the streaming instruction-solution pairs and create diverse, instructional, conversational, and
task-oriented datasets. These datasets can be used to analyze the behavior and capabilities of LLMs
and for future research for fine-tuning LLMs with conversational instructions.
AI Alignment. AI alignment is a field that aims to ensure that AI systems adhere to their intended
goals, interests, and values, as envisioned by their designers [4, 39, 110, 32, 38, 74, 10]. The first
attempt at AI alignment was made through the "Three Laws of Robotics," which was introduced
by Isaac Asimov in his science fiction stories [6]. Developing aligned AI systems is crucial for
achieving desired objectives while avoiding unintended consequences. Research in AI alignment
focuses on discouraging AI models from producing false, offensive, deceptive, or manipulative
information that could result in various harms [56, 112, 42, 37]. Achieving a high level of alignment
requires researchers to grapple with complex ethical, philosophical, and technical issues. We conduct
extensive experiments to study different role-playing situations, which probe the alignment of LLMs.
3 Methodology
In this paper, we focus on studying communicative agents under cooperative settings where they
share common interests. In particular, we study the assistant-user scenario, where a preliminary
idea is given at the start. Agents will conceptualize the idea into a specific task and complete it
autonomously through conversations.

Figure 1: CAMEL Role-Playing Framework. Our role-playing setup starts with the human user
having an idea they want to implement, e.g. develop a trading bot for the stock market. The roles
involved in this task would be an AI assistant agent who is a python programmer and an AI user
agent who is a stock trader. The task is made more specific using our task specifier agent, leading
to a well-defined task for the assistant to solve. Both AI user and AI assistant are provided with
the specified task, after which they collaboratively communicate by chatting with each other in an
instruction-following fashion to solve the specified task.
Our proposed framework is a novel role-playing approach for studying multiple communicative
agents. Specifically, we concentrate on task-oriented role-playing that involves one AI assistant and
one AI user. After the multi-agent system receives a preliminary idea and the role assignment from
human users, a task-specifier agent will provide a detailed description to make the idea specific.
Afterwards, the AI assistant and AI user will cooperate on completing the specified task through
multi-turn conversations until the AI user determines the task is done. The AI user is responsible for
giving instructions to the AI assistant and directing the conversation toward task completion. On the
other hand, the AI assistant is designed to follow the instructions from the AI user and respond with
specific solutions. The whole role-playing framework is depicted in Figure 1.
Human Input and Task Specifying. The role-playing session will be instantiated from an idea and
selected roles by humans. As an example in Figure 1, a human has a preliminary idea to develop
a trading bot for the stock market. Humans may or may not have the knowledge about how the
idea can be realized. What is needed is only to designate the potential roles that can implement the
idea. For instance, a Python Programmer could collaborate with a Stock Trader to realize the idea
of developing a trading bot for the stock market. After the idea and roles are determined, the task
specifier agent will brainstorm a specific task that the AI Assistant role can help with the AI user role
to complete based on the input idea. An example of a specified task in this scenario could be: develop
a trading bot with a sentiment analysis tool that can monitor social media platforms for positive or
negative comments about a particular stock, and execute trades based on sentiment analysis results.
The main motivation for introducing a task specifier is that conversational agents usually require
a concrete task prompt for realizing the task which might be challenging or time-consuming for a
non-domain expert. Therefore, the task specifier agent serves as an enhanced imagination module
for the idea implementation. Please note that, when studying our framework at a large scale for AI
society and Code scenarios, we generate roles and ideas automatically by prompting LLMs instead of
relying on human inputs. For our generated Math and Science datasets we generated problem topics,
subtopics, and problems automatically by prompting LLMs.
AI Assistant-User Role Assignment. After the task specification, The AI assistant role and the AI
user role will be assigned to the user agent and the assistant agent correspondingly to complete the
specified task. In practice, a system message is passed to each agent declaring their role. We refer
to the assistant system prompt/message by PA and that of the user by PU . The system messages
are passed to the agents before the conversations start. Let F1 and F2 denote two large-scale autoregressive language models [82]. When the system message is passed to those models respectively, we
4
obtain A ← F PA
1
and U ← F PU
2 which are referred to as the assistant and user agents respectively.
In Figure 1, the AI assistant and the AI user are assigned the roles of a Python Programmer and a
Stock Trader at the beginning of the role-playing session respectively. The AI user serves as a task
planner, engaging in interactive planning to determine feasible steps for the AI assistant to execute.
Meanwhile, the AI assistant acts as a task executor, offering solutions, executing planned steps, and
providing responses to the AI user.
Conversation Towards Task-Solving. After the role assignment is completed, the AI assistant A
and AI user U will collaborate in an instruction-following manner to accomplish the task. In the
AI assistant-user scenario, the AI user is responsible for providing instructions, and the assistant
is expected to respond with a solution that fulfills the instructions. Formally, we denote the user
instruction message obtained at time t by It and the assistant solution by St. The set of conversational
messages obtained up until time t is denoted by Equation (1) shown below:
Mt = {(I0, S0), ...,(It, St)} = {(Ii
, Si)}|t
i=0 (1)
At the next time step, t + 1, the AI user U takes the historical conversation message set Mt and
provides a new instruction It+1, as shown in Equation (2). The produced instruction message It+1 is
then passed, along with message set Mt, to the AI assistant A. The AI assistant will then respond
with a solution, denoted by St+1 in Equation (3):
It+1 = U(Mt) (2) St + 1 = A(Mt, It + 1) (3)
After obtaining the solution St+1 to the instruction It+1, the message set is updated using Equation
(4) to obtain Mt+1:
Mt+1 ← Mt ∪ (It+1, St+1) (4)
Note that the formulation above not only models AI-AI communicative scenarios, but it can also be
easily extended to model human-AI communication or communication between more than two agents.
Specifically, we can use message-passing graphs to model communication between an arbitrary
number of agents. In Figure 1, we observe that the AI user initiates the installation and import of
essential Python libraries for sentiment analysis and stock trading by instructing the AI assistant
through conversations. This example is drawn from our experiments, and the entire conversation is
available in the Appendix.
Critic-In-The-Loop. To enhance the controllability of the role-playing framework, we introduce
a critic agent capable of selecting proposals from or providing feedback to the role-playing agents.
This enables tree-search-like decision-making for task-solving. In practice, the critic can be either an
AI agent or a human. The detailed implementation and case studies can be found in the Appendix.
3.2 Inception Prompting
Since prompt engineering is crucial to our role-playing framework, this section delves deeply into
our prompting techniques. Our prompt engineering occurs solely at the beginning of role-playing, for
task specification and role assignment. Once the conversation phase commences, the AI assistant
and AI user prompt each other automatically in a loop until termination. As such, we refer to our
technique as Inception Prompting. Our Inception prompt consists of three prompts: the task specifier
prompt PT , the assistant system prompt PA, and the user system prompt PU . As an example, we
consider the inception prompt of the AI Society scenario. The templates for these prompts of AI
Society role-playing are shown in Figure 2. The task specifier prompt contains information about
the roles of the AI assistant and AI user in the role-playing session. Therefore, the task specifier
agent can take a preliminary task/idea as input and generate a specific task using imagination. The AI
assistant system prompt PA and the AI user system prompt PU are mostly symmetrical and include
information about the assigned task and roles, communication protocols, termination conditions, and
constraints or requirements to avoid unwanted behaviors. The prompt designs for both roles are
crucial to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. It is non-trivial to engineer prompts that
ensure agents act in alignment with our intentions. We take the prompt templates from the AI Society
in Figure 2 as an example to explain our key design choices. The prompts used for the Code scenario
follow a similar sprint as the AI society scenario, but with some additional engineering related to
programming languages. More details in the Appendix.

I must help you to complete the task.
Here is the task: <TASK>. Never forget our task!
You must instruct me based on my expertise and your needs to

1. Instruct with a necessary input:
Instruction: <YOUR_INSTRUCTION>
Input: <YOUR_INPUT>

task.
Figure 2: Inception Prompt of AI Society Role-Playing. This shows the task specifier prompt,
assistant system prompt, and user system prompt which are used for studying the AI society scenario.
Prompt Engineering. To delve deeper into the details in Figure 2, we start by chunking the various
parts of the AI assistant system prompt PA shown below:
• Never forget you are a <ASSISTANT_ROLE> and I am a <USER_ROLE>. This assigns
the chosen role to the assistant agent and provides it with information about the user’s role.
• Never flip roles! Never instruct me! This prevents agents from flipping roles. In
some cases, we have observed the assistant and the user switching roles, where the assistant
suddenly takes control and instructs the user, and the user follows those instructions.
• You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the
instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability
and explain the reasons. This prohibits the agent from producing harmful, false, illegal,
and misleading information.
• Unless I say the task is completed, you should always start with:
Solution: <YOUR_SOLUTION>. <YOUR_SOLUTION> should be specific, and
provide preferable implementations and examples for task-solving. This
6
encourages the assistant always responds in a consistent format, avoiding any deviation from the
structure of the conversation, and preventing vague or incomplete responses, which we refer to as
flake responses, such as "I will do something".
• Always end your solution with: Next request. This ensures that the assistant keeps
the conversation going by requesting a new instruction to solve.
For the AI user system prompt PU , we strive to maintain as much symmetry as possible with respect
to the AI assistant system prompt. Apart from the opposite role assignment, the user system prompt
differs from the assistant prompt in the following ways:
• You must instruct me ... to complete the task ONLY in the following two
ways: 1. Instruct with a necessary input: ...; 2. Instruct without
any input: ... This follows the typical data structure of instruction-following, which allows
the generated instruction-solution pairs to be easily used for fine-tuning LLMs.
• Keep giving me instructions and necessary inputs until you think the
task is completed. When the task is completed, you must only reply with
a single word <CAMEL_TASK_DONE>. We introduce an end-of-task token, namely,
<CAMEL_TASK_DONE>. This token is used once the user believes the task is done. This ensures
that the chat is terminated when the user is satisfied. Without doing so, the agents might fall into
a chatting loop where they keep on saying “thank you” to each other or “goodbye” indefinitely.
4 Experiments
In this section, we will discuss the various experiments that we conducted to arrive at our final design
choices. Specifically, we will examine the interesting observations, challenging issues, and several
examples we have encountered while enabling agents to communicate with each other under different
prompt design choices to achieve autonomous cooperation. In our experiments, we employed two
gpt-3.5-turbo agents, referred to as LLM agents for simplicity, with Inception Prompts, as described
in Section 3.2, to simulate assistant-user cooperation. For our analysis, we set our attention on AI
Society setting. We also gathered conversational data, named CAMEL AI Society and CAMEL Code
datasets and problem-solution pairs data named CAMEL Math and CAMEL Science and analyzed
and evaluated their quality. Moreover, we will discuss potential extensions of our framework and
highlight both the risks and opportunities that future AI society might present.

are generated using an LLM model to reduce human involvement in the generation process. The
generation prompts for both AI Society dataset are summarized in this figure.
4.1 Role-Playing for AI Society
To create our AI Society dataset, we have developed a scalable approach that follows a series of steps.
Firstly, we prompt the LLM agent to generate possible roles for the assistant and the user. We achieve
this by providing the LLM agent with specific prompts designed to elicit these roles. Next, we ask the
LLM agent to generate a range of possible tasks that can be solved through collaboration between the
7
assistant and user roles generated previously. After generating a range of possible tasks as described
in the previous step, we then use the task specifier prompt passed to the LLM agent to make the task
more specific. The prompts for assistant role generation, user role generation, and task generation
are shown in Figure 5 (AI Society). For our AI society dataset, we generated 50 assistant roles, 50
user roles, and 10 tasks for each combination of roles yielding a total of 25,000 conversations. The
generated assistant roles and user roles for AI Society as well as details about the generation of Code,
Math and Science datasets can be found in the Appendix.
Challenges and Observations. In this section, we explore the four main challenges that we identified
during our analysis of the generated datasets. Our observations shed light on some interesting aspects
of cooperative AI and the difficulties that arise in its development.
• Role Flipping: One challenge we encountered was role flipping, where the assistant and user
switch roles during the conversation. This issue typically arises when the assistant starts providing
instructions or commands instead of following the user’s prompts, which can lead to confusion
and a reversal of roles. To avoid role flipping, it is crucial for the assistant not to ask questions, as
this can also contribute to the problem.
• Assistant Repeats Instruction: Another challenge that we observed was the assistant
simply repeating the user’s instructions without any role flipping occurring.
• Flake Replies: We also observed instances where the assistant agent responds with a flake
reply, often taking the form of "I will...". These messages do not contribute to the task at hand, as
the assistant promises to take action but ultimately fails to follow through.
• Infinite Loop of Messages: An interesting challenge that we encountered was when the
assistant and user engage in an infinite loop of meaningless conversation, such as repeatedly
thanking each other or saying goodbye without progressing the task. Interestingly, in some cases,
the assistant and user are aware that they are stuck in a loop, but are unable to break out of it.
The Appendix shows examples of each of the four challenges discussed above. Overall, our observations highlight the complexity of cooperative AI development and the need for continued exploration
and innovation to overcome the challenges we face. By identifying these issues, we hope to contribute
to the development of more effective and engaging cooperative AI systems.
Termination Conditions. The conversation between the assistant and user agents is designed to
follow a specific format to ensure consistent and accurate data generation. To ensure that both the
user and assistant adhere to their respective roles and responsibilities, certain conditions have been
set in place to terminate the chat if necessary. These conditions are outlined below:
• User No Instruct: If the user does not instruct the assistant for 3 rounds, conversation is ended.
• Assistant Instruct: If the assistant provides an instruction to the user, it indicates a role
reversal, and the conversation is terminated.
• End of Task Token: If the user believes that the task has been solved, they are expected to
say <CAMEL_TASK_DONE> to signify the completion of the task. Once this message is received,
the conversation is terminated.
• Assistant&User Token Limit: Given that gpt-3.5-turbo has a limitation on the number
of tokens, the conversation is terminated if either the assistant or the user reach the token limit.
• Maximum Number of Messages: To keep the cost of generated chats in check, we have set
a maximum limit of 40 messages. This limit guarantees a long enough conversation between
the user and assistant while also ensuring that the data generated is not too costly to produce.
The cost grows quadratically with the length of the conversation, making it essential to set a limit.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Agent Evaluation
In order to assess the performance of CAMEL (Cooperative Role-playing Communication), we
conduct two types of evaluations: (1) Human evaluation, and (2) GPT4 evaluation. We randomly
select 100 tasks from our AI Society dataset for evaluation and 100 tasks from our Code dataset.
Then, we employ the GPT4 model to summarize the content of the CAMEL conversation-based
8
solution, presenting a consolidated final solution. Particularly, a GPT4 is used since it possesses a
larger token limit which is suitable for summarization. Summarization also makes CAMEL agents’
solution undetectable by its format, allowing for a more fair comparison. Subsequently, this solution
is compared with a single-shot solution generated by the gpt-3.5-turbo model for the same task.
Sample tasks are provided in the Appendix.
Human Evaluation. For this evaluation, we present both the CAMEL summarized agent solution
and the gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution side-by-side to human participants. The identity behind
each solution is not revealed. Participants are then asked to vote on whether one solution is superior
to the other or if they are equally good. A total of 453 responses were collected during this evaluation.
Note that, human evaluation is only done for AI Society, as assessing code is generally harder for
humans (without running the code).
GPT4 Evaluation. We engage a GPT4 agent to evaluate the effectiveness of Model 1 (CAMEL Agent
solution) versus Model 2 (gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution) for each task. More specifically, we
prompt GPT4 to score and decide which solution of the two solutions is better.
Results. The summarized results of each evaluation are outlined in Table 1 which showcases that the
CAMEL solution outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution in both the human evaluation
and the GPT4 evaluation by a big margin. It is also worth noting that both human evaluation and
GPT4 evaluation are highly aligned.
Table 1: Agent Evaluation Results: Results of the evaluations of the CAMEL agent against
gpt-3.5-turbo using both human evaluators and GPT4 consistently show that utilizing a multiagent cooperative approach is more effective than gpt-3.5-turbo’s single shot solution.

5.2 GPT4 for ChatBot Evaluation
In this section, we progressively fine-tune a LLaMA 7B model on our generated datasets. By
progressively incorporating diverse datasets like AI society, code, math, and science, we expect
fine-tuned model to demonstrate the ability to develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of
these domains.
We initially start by training on AI society dataset, which aims to let the model learn about human
interactions and societal dynamics. As additional datasets were introduced, such as code, the model
gained knowledge of programming logic and syntax, enabling it to generate coherent and executable
code snippets. The inclusion of the math dataset further expanded the model’s capabilities, allowing
it to solve complex equations, reason about abstract concepts, and perform precise calculations.
Finally, exposure to the science dataset broadened the model’s understanding of scientific theories,
empirical observations, and experimental methods. The emergence of model capabilities is measured
by evaluating the quality of the model responses, before and after training on the new domain, on a
set of questions of varying difficulties from each domain. More precisely, the model is tested on 20
AI Society related tasks, 20 coding tasks, 20 math tasks and 60 science tasks.
Those results are highlighted in Table 2 where we see that each time we add a dataset, the model
performs better on the incorporated domain. Note that to measure the quality of the models’ responses,
we follow the evaluation from Section T, which involves prompting a GPT4 agent to score and decide
which solution is better. It is worth noting that an improvement on other domains is also observed in
some cases such as when we train on Code we improve on Science. This is because our Code dataset
contains problems that solve tasks in particular domains which include scientific domain. Similarly,
training on AI Society improves code as AI Society contains the role of a "programmer" and hence
coding related conversations. Finally, note that the draws observed in LLaMA-7B vs AI Society in
Math reflects equally bad solutions compared to the draws observed in AI Society + Code + Math vs
AI Society + Code + Math + Science where the draws are equally good solutions. This progression
from AI society to code to math to science highlights the potential of AI models to acquire a versatile
and adaptable knowledge base, paralleling the way humans gain expertise in diverse subjects. Sample
tasks are provided in the Appendix.

Table 2: Emergence of Knowledge. By progressively fine-tuning LLaMA on datasets from different
domains, we observe the emergence of knowledge as the model transitions from AI society to code,
math, and science. This finding is indicated by the fact that Model 2 almost always performs better
than Model 1, especially on the added dataset.

Vicuna-7B 11.0 42.9 9.9 34.7
CAMEL-7B 14.0 57.9 12.2 50.0
To evaluate the coding task-solving capabilities of our CAMEL model, specifically the LLaMA7B fine-tuned on our comprehensive datasets, we rely on HumanEval [18] and HumanEval+ [69].
The results, as depicted in table 3, clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of CAMEL. It
surpasses not only the LLaMA-7B model but also Vicuna-7B [21] by a big margin. These findings
underscore the critical role played by the generated datasets in enhancing LLaMA’s ability to tackle
coding-related tasks.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we explore the potential of autonomous cooperation among communicative agents
and propose a novel cooperative agent framework named role-playing . Our approach enables
communicative agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while requiring minimal
human intervention, leading to better solutions are per our thorough evaluations. Through our analysis,
we show that achieving autonomous cooperation is challenging due to issues like conversation
deviation, role flipping, and termination conditions. Our framework offers a scalable approach for
studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems and provides strategies
for addressing these challenges. Furthermore, our open-sourced library includes implementations
of various agents, data generation pipelines, data analysis tools, and collected datasets, to support
research on communicative agents and beyond. Our contributions offer valuable insights into the
future of large language artificial intelligence models and cooperative AI systems.

H.1 Example 1:
Agent Evaluation: Sample Task # 1
AI Society (AI Assistant: Programmer & AI User: Filmmaker)
Task:
Creating a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as
action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, potentially using machine
learning algorithms.
CAMEL Agents’ Solution (Summarized):
To create a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as
action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, potentially using machine
learning algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Install Python on your computer by following these steps:
• Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/
• Click on the "Download" button for the latest version of Python.
• Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or
Linux).
• Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation process.
2. Install the required libraries for Python:
• OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
• NumPy: pip install numpy
• SciPy: pip install scipy
• scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn
3. Write a Python script that reads in a video file and extracts each frame as an image file:
import cv2
import os
video_path = " path /to/ video / file . mp4"
if not os . path . exists (" frames ") :
os . makedirs (" frames ")
cap = cv2 . VideoCapture ( video_path )
count = 0
while cap . isOpened () :
ret , frame = cap . read ()
if ret :
cv2 . imwrite (" frames / frame %d. jpg" % count , frame )
count += 1
else :
break
cap . release ()
cv2 . destroyAllWindows ()
4. Write a Python script that takes in a directory of image files and creates a video file from
those images:
import cv2
import os
image_dir = " path /to/ image / directory "
30
image_files = [ os . path . join ( image_dir , f ) for f in os . listdir (
image_dir ) if f . endswith (".jpg") ]
image_files . sort ()
img = cv2 . imread ( image_files [0])
height , width , channels = img . shape
fourcc = cv2 . VideoWriter_fourcc (*" mp4v ")
out = cv2 . VideoWriter (" output .mp4", fourcc , 30.0 , ( width , height )
)
for image_file in image_files :
img = cv2 . imread ( image_file )
out . write ( img )
out . release ()
cv2 . destroyAllWindows ()
5. Write a Python script that uses OpenCV to detect and track faces in a video file:
import cv2
video_path = " path /to/ video / file . mp4"
cap = cv2 . VideoCapture ( video_path )
face_cascade = cv2 . CascadeClassifier ( cv2 . data . haarcascades + "
haarcascade_frontalface_default .xml")
multi_tracker = cv2 . MultiTracker_create ()
while cap . isOpened () :
ret , frame = cap . read ()
if ret :
gray = cv2 . cvtColor ( frame , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2GRAY )
faces = face_cascade . detectMultiScale ( gray , scaleFactor
=1.1 , minNeighbors =5 , minSize =(30 , 30) )
boxes = []
for (x , y , w , h ) in faces :
boxes . append (( x , y , w , h ))
trackers = cv2 . MultiTracker_create ()
for box in boxes :
tracker = cv2 . TrackerKCF_create ()
trackers . add ( tracker , frame , box )
success , boxes = trackers . update ( frame )
for box in boxes :
(x , y , w , h ) = [ int ( v ) for v in box ]
cv2 . rectangle ( frame , (x , y ) , ( x + w , y + h ) , (0 , 255 ,
0) , 2)
cv2 . imshow (" Frame ", frame )
if cv2 . waitKey (1) & 0 xFF == ord ("q") :
break
else :
break
cap . release ()
cv2 . destroyAllWindows ()
These scripts will help you read and process video files, extract frames, create videos from
images, and detect and track faces in videos. You can further develop these scripts to
31
analyze complex footage elements and suggest optimal cuts and edits using machine learning
algorithms.
GPT Single Shot Solution (gpt-3.5-turbo):
To create a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as
action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, you can follow these steps:
1. Identify the key elements that need to be analyzed in the footage, such as camera
angles, lighting, movement, and special effects.
2. Determine the criteria for optimal cuts and edits, such as pacing, continuity, and
visual impact.
3. Develop machine learning algorithms that can analyze the footage and suggest
optimal cuts and edits based on the criteria.
4. Train the algorithms using a large dataset of footage that includes a variety of complex
elements.
5. Integrate the algorithms into a user-friendly interface that allows editors to easily
apply the suggested cuts and edits to their footage.
6. Continuously refine and improve the algorithms based on user feedback and new
developments in machine learning technology.
By following these steps, you can create a powerful post-production workflow tool that can
help editors save time and improve the quality of their work.

H.2 Example 2:
Agent Evaluation: Sample Task # 2
AI Society (AI Assistant: Doctor & AI User: Artist)
Task:
On the task of creating medical illustrations, the Artist will collaborate with the Doctor to
accurately visualize and depict internal structures and disease states of the digestive system
for use in illustration-based curriculum content. A balance between artistic flair, accuracy in
demonstration of related health anomalies and duration of the scripted classroom discussion
will be explored and decided together.
CAMEL Agents’ Solution (Summarized):
The major organs of the digestive system are:
1. Mouth
2. Esophagus
3. Stomach
4. Small intestine
5. Large intestine
6. Rectum
7. Anus
8. Liver
9. Pancreas
10. Gallbladder
The stomach is a J-shaped organ that can expand to accommodate up to 2-3 liters of food and
liquid. It has four main layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa. The
stomach mixes and grinds food with gastric juices to form chyme, secretes hydrochloric acid,
and releases chyme into the small intestine in small amounts.
The small intestine is a long, narrow tube divided into three sections: the duodenum, the
jejunum, and the ileum. It has a highly folded inner surface area covered in villi and microvilli,
which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The small intestine receives partially
digested food from the stomach and continues to break it down using enzymes produced by
the pancreas and liver. It also absorbs nutrients and delivers them to the bloodstream.
The large intestine, also known as the colon, is a wider tube divided into four sections: the
ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. It absorbs
water and electrolytes from the remaining food matter, forming solid feces. The large intestine
also houses a large number of bacteria that help to break down undigested food and produce
vitamins. The cecum, the appendix, and the rectum are important structures within the large
intestine.
Common digestive system disorders include:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
2. Peptic ulcer disease
3. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
4. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
5. Celiac disease
6. Diverticulitis
7. Gallstones
8. Pancreatitis
9. Hemorrhoids
10. Colorectal cancer
33
GERD is a condition in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms
such as heartburn, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, chronic cough, and
hoarseness or sore throat. Symptoms may be worse after eating, lying down, or bending
over, and may also be worse at night or in the morning. If left untreated, GERD can lead to
complications such as esophagitis, strictures, and Barrett’s esophagus, which can increase the
risk of esophageal cancer.
GPT Single Shot Solution (gpt-3.5-turbo):
The task involves creating medical illustrations of the digestive system in collaboration with a
doctor. The illustrations should accurately depict internal structures and disease states of the
digestive system for use in educational content. The artist and doctor will work together to
strike a balance between artistic flair and accuracy in demonstrating related health anomalies.
The duration of the scripted classroom discussion will also be taken into consideration.

Below we show sample solutions obtained by LLaMA-7B v.s. our model and the resulting GPT4
review.
Sample Chatbot Answers
Question: What is the slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8)?
[Category: Math]
LLaMA-7B Solution:
The slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8) is:
Our Final Model Solution:
To find the slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8), we can use the slope
formula:
m = (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1)
where m is the slope, (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the first point, and (x2, y2) are the
coordinates of the second point.
Plugging in the given points, we have:
m =
(8−4)
(7−3)
m =
4
4
m = 1
The slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8) is 1.
GPT4 Review:
First, I will solve the problem independently:
To find the slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8), we can use the slope
formula:
m =
(y2−y1)
(x2−x1)
where m is the slope, (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the first point, and (x2, y2) are the
coordinates of the second point.
Plugging in the given points, we have:
m =
(8−4)
(7−3)
m =
4
4
m = 1
The slope of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (7, 8) is 1.
Now, I will evaluate the answers provided by Assistant 1 and Assistant 2:
Assistant 1’s Answer: The answer is incomplete, as Assistant 1 did not provide any steps or a
final answer.
Assistant 2’s Answer: Assistant 2 correctly used the slope formula and plugged in the given
points. The calculations were done correctly, and the final answer of 1 is accurate.
Based on the evaluation, I would give the following scores:
Assistant 1: 1 (incomplete answer) Assistant 2: 10 (correct problem-solving steps and
accurate answer)
Assistant 2 performed better in this case.

LLaMA-7B Solution:
The body regulates its internal temperature by cooling the body down when it is too hot,
and warming it up when it is too cold. You can do this by sweating, shivering, or panting.
Sweating cools the body by evaporating water off of the skin, and shivering warms the body
by causing the blood vessels to constrict and blood to flow to the skin surface. Panting warms
the body by causing the body to take in more oxygen.
Our Final Model Solution:
The human body regulates its internal temperature through a process called thermoregulation.
This process involves a complex interplay between the hypothalamus, a region in the brain,
and various organs and systems throughout the body. The hypothalamus acts as the body’s
thermostat, maintaining a constant core body temperature of approximately 98.6
◦F (37◦C).
Here are some key components of thermoregulation:
1. Hypothalamus: The hypothalamus constantly monitors the body’s core temperature
and initiates appropriate responses to maintain the optimal temperature. It receives
information about body temperature from thermoreceptors, which are specialized
nerve cells located in the skin, spinal cord, and other internal organs.
2. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction: When the body temperature rises above the
optimal level, the hypothalamus triggers vasodilation, which is the widening of blood
vessels, particularly those near the surface of the skin. This allows more blood to
flow to the skin, increasing heat loss through radiation and conduction. Conversely,
when the body temperature falls below the optimal level, the hypothalamus causes
vasoconstriction, narrowing the blood vessels to reduce blood flow to the skin and
minimize heat loss.
3. Sweating and shivering: The hypothalamus also stimulates sweat glands to produce
sweat, which is released onto the skin’s surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools
the body down. On the other hand, when the body needs to generate more heat, the
hypothalamus triggers shivering, which is the rapid contraction and relaxation of
muscles. This generates heat through increased metabolic activity.
4. Hormonal regulation: The hypothalamus can also stimulate the release of hormones,
such as adrenaline and thyroxine, which can increase the body’s metabolic rate and
heat production. Additionally, the hypothalamus can inhibit the release of some
hormones, such as somatostatin, which can help conserve heat by reducing metabolic
activity.
5. Behavioral responses: In addition to these physiological responses, the hypothalamus
can also trigger behavioral responses to help regulate body temperature. For example,
a person may feel the need to remove clothing, seek shade, or drink cold water when
the body temperature rises, or put on clothing, seek shelter, or consume warm food
and drinks when the body temperature falls.
In summary, the human body regulates its internal temperature through a complex interplay
between the hypothalamus, various organs and systems, and hormonal regulation. This
ensures that the body maintains a stable core temperature, which is essential for optimal
physiological functioning.
GPT4 Review:
8 10 Assistant 1 provided a brief and somewhat accurate answer, but it lacked detail and
organization. The mention of panting is incorrect, as it is not a mechanism humans use to
regulate body temperature. Assistant 2, on the other hand, provided a comprehensive and wellorganized answer, explaining the process of thermoregulation, the role of the hypothalamus,
and various mechanisms the body uses to maintain its internal temperature. Assistant 2’s
answer also included hormonal regulation and behavioral responses, making it more complete
and informative.

J Dataset Analysis
All the generated datasets are made available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/
camel-ai. This section analyzes two datasets that we have generated, namely AI Society and
Code. We provide an ablation study of the AI Society dataset. We make two changes: one modifies
the assistant role prompt, and the other introduces task planning before presenting the task to the user
and agent. Additionally, We examine the diversity of topics covered in each dataset by visualizing the
information cartography of the instructions and tasks in each dataset. We also check the distribution
of termination reasons within each dataset.
Next we examine the conversation termination reasons for both AI Society and Code datasets. As can
be seen in Figure 8, the main termination reasons for AI Society dataset is Assistant Instruct
whereas for Code it is Token Limit. The latter is expected as the since responses that contain code
tend to be long. It is also interesting to note that in both datasets, the termination due to Maximum
Number of Messages is low indicating that the limit of 40 maximum messages is reasonable. Our
decision to limit the number of messages to 40 is also cost-related. Even if we provide a set of
termination conditions, we still want to put a safeguard to the maximum limit of the message. It
is because after the task is completed the agents will provide short outputs like "thank you" and
"welcome". If no safeguard is set and termination fails, the conversation will only end until it exceeds
the token limit, which may end up with thousands of API calls and hundreds of USD dollars cost.
We study the effect of the prompt design on the conversation termination distribution. We design
Prompt V2 which modifies the original AI society prompt by removing the assistant response format
i.e. starting with “Solution” and asking for “Next request”. The second ablation adds a task planner
to the original prompt. A task planner aids in breaking down tasks into smaller subtasks in advance.
These planned subtasks are then shared with both the assistant and the user, enabling them to anticipate
and effectively plan for addressing each subtask.
As seen in Figure 9, we notice that both modifications considerably increases the number of conversations that terminate with end of task token, and reduce the number of messages with assistant
instruction. However, we observe a significant increase in the number of flake messages for Prompt
V2 and Prompt V1 + Task Planner compared to original Prompt V1 as seen in Figure 10.
Figures 11 and 12 show the information cartography of the instructions and tasks obtained for AI
Society respectively. The subjects covered in AI Society cover a wide range of technicality. Topics
cover lifestyle, social media, content creation, and software development. Tasks include providing
support, analysis, training, and brainstorming. Figures 13 and 14 show the information cartography
of the instructions and tasks obtained for Code respectively. The covered topics have relevance to
a broad range of individuals. Topics cover sentiment analysis, language and data processing, data
collection, and machine learning.
Figure 8: Distribution of Conversation Termination Reasons. In our AI society dataset, most
methods are terminated due to Assistant Instruct flag, whereas in the code dataset the main
termination reason is Token Limit. The latter is due big chunks of code in the assistant responses.
38
Figure 9: Ablation Distribution of Conversation Termination Reasons (AI Society) Due to
Prompt Modification. We run two ablations: (1) Prompt V2 which refers to modifying the original
AI society prompt by removing the assistant output format, i.e. starting with “Output:” and ending
with “Next Request” and (2) Adding a task planner to the original Prompt V1. Task planner takes the
specified task and generates a subtask division for the assistant and user to follow. Both ablations
show an increase in the number of conversations terminated due to End of Task Token and a
decrease in Assistant Instruct rate.
Figure 10: Flake Message Distribution (AI Society). We quantify and visualize the number of
flake messages, i.e. ones that start with “I will ...” and do not progress towards task completion. Our
original prompt shows the least amount of flake messages compared to both presented ablations.

K Check List Requirements
K.1 Broader Impacts and Limitations:
Risk, Limitation and Future Work. We are aware of the potential risks and limitations of this
work. For the risks, since existing LLMs are not fully tuned to be harmless, they can be easily
exploited by malicious users for harmful purposes. We provide an example of the “evil mind” that
LLM agents could possess in the supplemental materials by asking a hacker to help an AGI agent to
“take control of the world”. For the limitations, due to the large scale and diversity of tasks generated
by our role-playing framework, evaluating its task completion capabilities poses a challenge that
necessitates the involvement of numerous domain experts. However, we also note that due to the
complexity of society and the cost of using OpenAI API, this work only touches the tip of the
iceberg of the AI society. For future work, in our experiments, we considered the setting where two
conversational agents communicate with each other to solve a problem. This setting can be easily
extended to include more than two chat agents. Moreover, setting agents to compete and challenge
each other could reveal further insights into the interaction of such communicative LLM agents.

L Examples from Datasets
In this section, we showcase some of the examples generated using our CAMEL framework.
Biology
User Message: How do the composition and diversity of microbial communities on human
skin impact the development of skin diseases and disorders, and what are the potential
strategies for modulating the microbiota to promote healthy skin?
Assistant Message: The composition and diversity of microbial communities on human skin
play a crucial role in the development of skin diseases and disorders. The skin microbiota,
consisting of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mites, forms a complex ecosystem that contributes
to skin health and homeostasis. Imbalances in this ecosystem, known as dysbiosis, can lead to
various skin conditions, including acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rosacea.
Impact of skin microbiota on skin diseases and disorders:
1. Competition for resources: A diverse and balanced microbial community can prevent
the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms by competing for nutrients and space,
thus maintaining skin health.
2. Immune system modulation: The skin microbiota can modulate the host’s immune
system, promoting tolerance to commensal microorganisms and preventing excessive
inflammation. Dysbiosis can lead to an overactive immune response, contributing to
the development of inflammatory skin disorders.
3. Production of antimicrobial substances: Some commensal bacteria produce antimicrobial peptides and other substances that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic
microorganisms, protecting the skin from infections.
4. Barrier function: A healthy skin microbiota contributes to the maintenance of
the skin’s barrier function, preventing the penetration of allergens, irritants, and
pathogens.
Potential strategies for modulating the microbiota to promote healthy skin:
1. Probiotics: The use of topical or oral probiotics containing beneficial bacteria can
help restore the balance of the skin microbiota, reducing inflammation and improving
skin health. Some studies have shown promising results in the treatment of acne,
atopic dermatitis, and other skin conditions.
2. Prebiotics: Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. The use of prebiotic-containing skincare products can help support a healthy
skin microbiota and prevent dysbiosis.
3. Skin pH modulation: The skin’s pH plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced
microbial community. Using skincare products with a pH similar to that of the skin
(around 4.5-5.5) can help maintain a healthy skin microbiota.
4. Hygiene practices: Over-washing or using harsh cleansers can disrupt the skin
microbiota, leading to dysbiosis. Adopting gentle cleansing routines and avoiding the
overuse of antimicrobial agents can help preserve the balance of the skin microbiota.
5. Lifestyle factors: Diet, stress, and sleep can also impact the skin microbiota. A
balanced diet, stress management, and adequate sleep can contribute to a healthy
skin microbiota and overall skin health.
In conclusion, the composition and diversity of microbial communities on human skin have a
significant impact on the development of skin diseases and disorders. Modulating the skin
microbiota through various strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and lifestyle changes,
can promote healthy skin and prevent or alleviate skin conditions. Further research is needed
to better understand the complex interactions between the skin microbiota and host factors,
leading to the development of more targeted and effective therapies for skin disorders.

Physics
User Message: A gas is compressed from an initial volume of 6.0 L to a final volume of 2.0
L, while the pressure is kept constant at 2.5 atm. If the gas initially had a temperature of 300
K, what is the work done on the gas during this process?
Assistant Message: To calculate the work done on the gas during this isochoric (constant
pressure) process, we can use the formula:
W = −P · ∆V
where W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ∆V is the change in volume.
First, let’s find the change in volume:
∆V = Vfinal − Vinitial
∆V = 2.0 L − 6.0 L
∆V = −4.0 L
Now, we can calculate the work done:
W = −P · ∆V
W = −(2.5 atm) · (−4.0 L)
W = 10.0 L · atm
To convert the work done from L·atm to Joules, we can use the conversion factor:
1 L · atm = 101.325 J
W = 10.0 L · atm ·

101.325 J
1 L · atm 
W = 1013.25 J
So, the work done on the gas during this process is approximately 1013.25 Joules.
Chemistry
User Message: Determine the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) using the
oxidation state rules and justify your answer with proper explanation.
Assistant Message: To determine the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3),
we will use the oxidation state rules:
1. The oxidation state of an atom in a free element is zero.
2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.
3. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule is zero, and in an
ion, it is equal to the ion’s charge.
In sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), we have two sodium (Na) atoms, one sulfur (S) atom, and three
oxygen (O) atoms. Sodium is an alkali metal, and its oxidation state in compounds is usually
+1. Oxygen is a non-metal, and its oxidation state in most compounds is −2.
Let’s assign oxidation states to the atoms in Na2SO3:
• Sodium (Na): +1 (each)
• Oxygen (O): −2 (each)
• Sulfur (S): x (unknown)
Now, we will apply rule 3. Since sodium sulfite is a neutral molecule, the sum of the oxidation
states of all atoms should be zero.
2(+1) + x + 3(−2) = 0
48
Solve for x:
2 + x − 6 = 0
x − 4 = 0
x = 4
So, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is +4.
Mathematics
User Message: Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 16.
Assistant Message: To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can
do this by following these steps:
1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3x + 7 − 7 = 16 − 7
3x = 9
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:
3x
3
=
9
3
x = 3
So, the solution is x = 3.

N Embodied Agent
In the previous studies, the agents are simulated in a sandbox without actually interacting with the
real world or executing actions with external tools. We observe sometimes the agents forget the
previous thread of instruction flow, it is mainly related to agents asking for information that would not
be able to perform due to the lack of embodiment or physical information such as date, emails, files,
location, etc. For instance, an AI user agent asks an AI assistant agent to book a meeting schedule in
its calendar. However, the AI assistant agent does not ask for access to the AI user agent’s calendar.
Then the AI assistant agent will ask for the AI user agent’s calendar access. However, we did not
provide calendar API accesses to the AI user which will result in an answer like "as an AI language
model, I do not have access to the calendar." and cause the forgetting of the thread of instruction
flow. This could be solved by providing API access to embodiment or physical information. Recent
research has demonstrated that the capabilities of LLMs can be significantly improved through the
utilization of tools or by leveraging APIs [100, 16, 83, 124, 135]. In this section, we discuss how
our agents could be equipped with embodiment and use tools to perform actions for solving tasks.
We define embodied agents as physical entities assigned to solve a specific task. It can perform
various actions in the physical world, such as browsing the Internet, reading documents, creating
content such as images, audio and videos, and executing code. The agent receives thoughts from a
role and executes the described actions within a defined action space by executing code. The agent
can perform multiple actions in any order. The detailed prompt is shown in Figure 15. Specifically,
we demonstrate how our agents can utilize code to invoke HuggingFace’s tool agents [124] that, in
turn, utilize Stable Diffusion [94] for image generation. As shown in Figure 16, the embodied agent
is asked to draw all the Camelidae species. It first reasons about what animals are included in the
Camelidae family and then generates and saves images.
System Prompt of Embodied Agent
You are the physical embodiment of the <ROLE> who is working on solving a task: <TASK>. You can do
things in the physical world including browsing the Internet, reading documents, drawing images,
creating videos, executing code, and so on. Your job is to perform the physical actions necessary
to interact with the physical world. You will receive thoughts from the <ROLE> and you will need to
perform the actions described in the thoughts. You can write a series of simple commands in Python
to act. You can perform a set of actions by calling the available Python functions. You should
perform actions based on the descriptions of the functions.
Here is your action space: <ACTION_SPACE>
You should only perform actions in the action space. You can perform multiple actions. You can
perform actions in any order. First, explain the actions you will perform and your reasons, then
write the Python code to implement your actions. You may print intermediate results if necessary.

Generating Images with Embodied Agents
Input: Draw all the Camelidae species.
Output:
> Embodied Actions: I will generate images of all the Camelidae species. The Camelidae
family includes the following species: Dromedary camel, Bactrian camel, Guanaco, Llama,
Alpaca, and Vicuna. I will use the hugging_face_tool_agent to create images for each
species and save them as separate files.

O Critic-In-The-Loop
Aligning fully autonomous cooperation with human intention can be challenging when humans are
interested in tasks that have clear goals or when humans have strong preferences for the solution.
To enhance the controllability of our role-playing framework, we propose the Critic-In-The-Loop
technique. This approach facilitates cooperative task completion by incorporating human preferences,
enabling tree-search-like decision-making for solving tasks, which is inspired by Monte-Carlo Tree
Search (MTCS) methods [107]. The critic can be either an AI agent or a human, depending on
practical considerations. The system prompt of the critic agent is shown in Figure 17. A diagram of
the tree search process is shown in Figure 18. It includes the expansion steps from the user agent
and assistant agent and the selection steps from the critic agent. Differing from defining a heuristic
function in MTCS, the selection criteria of the critic agent are based on prompt engineering or human
preference. An example of a critic as an AI agent in Figure 19 demonstrates the conversation between
a user agent as a Postdoc, an assistant agent as a Ph.D. student, and a critic agent as a Professor in
which they are collaborating on writing a research proposal for large-scale language models. The
selection criteria are simply improving the task performance.
System Prompt of Critic Agent
You are a <CRITIC_ROLE> who teams up with a <USER_ROLE> and a <ASSISTANT_ROLE> to solve a task:
<TASK>.
Your job is to select an option from their proposals and provides your explanations.
Your selection criteria are <CRITERIA>.
You always have to choose an option from the proposals.

Critic in the Loop Example
Original Task. Write a research proposal for large-scale language models.
Specified Task. PhD student will help Postdoc develop a research proposal exploring ethical
considerations surrounding the development of large-scale language models, specifically
examining the potential for discriminatory algorithms and strategies to mitigate these risks.
User Message:
• Option 1:
Understood. Let’s begin by discussing the current state of large-scale language
models and any existing ethical concerns.
• Option 2:
Understood. Let’s begin by first reviewing some background research on large-scale
language models and their potential for discriminatory algorithms. We can then
explore strategies to mitigate these risks in the research proposal.
• Option 3:
Understood. Let’s begin by discussing the potential for discriminatory algorithms in
large-scale language models. Have you identified any specific examples or areas of
concern?
Critic Choice:
I would recommend Option 2. This option sets the stage for a well-informed and structured
discussion. By reviewing background research on large-scale language models and their potential for discriminatory algorithms, we can identify existing concerns and better understand
the ethical implications. This knowledge will then help us formulate strategies to address and
mitigate those risks in the proposed research.
Option 1 is also a good approach, but it lacks a clear structure and may not cover all the
necessary aspects of the task. Option 3 is too narrow in scope and may not provide a
comprehensive understanding of the ethical concerns surrounding large-scale language models.
Assistant Message:
• Option 1:
Yes, that’s a great idea. To start, we can look at some recent studies that have
highlighted the potential for bias and discrimination in large-scale language models.
One example is the study conducted by Bolukbasi et al. (2016), which showed that
word embeddings learned from text corpora can reflect gender stereotypes and biases.
Another study by Caliskan et al. (2017) found that language models trained on text
from the web can exhibit racial and gender biases.
We can also look at recent news articles and reports that have highlighted the risks
associated with large-scale language models, such as the controversy surrounding
OpenAI’s GPT-2 model and concerns about its potential to generate harmful content.
By reviewing this background research, we can better understand the potential risks
associated with large-scale language models and identify key areas to focus on in our
research proposal.
• Option 2:
Great idea! To start, we can look at some recent studies that have found evidence of
bias and discrimination in large-scale language models, such as the ones developed
by GPT-3. Some of the main concerns include:
1. Lack of diversity in training data: Language models are trained on large amounts
of text data, which may not represent the diversity of human experiences and perspectives. This can lead to biased language and discriminatory outputs.
2. Amplification of existing biases: Language models may learn and reproduce
existing biases present in the training data, such as gender, race, and stereotypes.

P On the Role Selection
For a given task, such as the stock trading example presented in A, the selection of the assistant and
user roles was done manually. The role assignment could be either automated or sub-divided into
multi-stage role assignment.
Multi-stage role assignment: could be achieved by performing multiple rounds of role-playing
with different experts. For example, for the Stock Trading App example, we could have a first stage
where a stock trader collaborates with a tech lead and another stage where a python programmer
collaborates with the tech lead to achieve the stock trader’s desires.
Two Stage Role-Assignment
Stage 1: Tech Lead (Assistant) v.s. Stock Trader (User)
Task: Figure out an implementation plan for developing a trading bot for the stock market.
Stage 2: Python programmer (Assistant) v.s. Tech Lead (User)
Task: Develop a trading bot for the stock market. Plan obtained from Stage 1.
Stage 1: Tech Lead (AI Assistant) v.s. Stock Trader (AI User)
Task: Figure out an implementation plan for developing a trading bot for the stock market.
User Message:
Instruction: Determine the technical requirements for developing the trading bot.
Input: None
Assistant Message:
Solution: To develop a trading bot for the stock market, there are several technical requirements that need to be considered. Here are some key technical requirements:
1. Programming Language: Choose a programming language that is suitable for developing the trading bot. Popular choices include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
Consider factors such as the availability of libraries and frameworks for data analysis
and trading, as well as the team’s expertise.
2. Data Access: Determine how the trading bot will access market data. This can be
done through APIs provided by stock exchanges or third-party data providers. Ensure

User Message:
Instruction: Determine the frequency of data updates and trading decisions for the trading
bot.
Input: None
Assistant Message:
Solution: The frequency of data updates and trading decisions for the trading bot depends
on various factors, including the trading strategy, market conditions, and the desired level of
activity. Here are some considerations to determine the frequency:
1. Data Updates:
• Real-Time: If the trading strategy relies on real-time market data and requires
quick reaction times, the bot should receive real-time data updates. This can be
achieved by subscribing to real-time data feeds or using APIs that provide live
market data.
• Batch Updates: If the trading strategy does not require real-time data and can
operate on delayed or periodic updates, the bot can process data in batches. This
can involve fetching data at regular intervals, such as every minute, hour, or day,
depending on the strategy’s requirements.
• Trading Decisions:
• High-Frequency Trading: For high-frequency trading strategies, where the bot
aims to execute a large number of trades within a short time frame, trading
decisions need to be made frequently. This can involve making decisions and
executing trades within seconds or milliseconds.
• Intraday Trading: If the trading strategy focuses on intraday trading, trading
decisions can be made multiple times throughout the trading day. This can
involve analyzing data and making trading decisions at specific intervals, such
as every 15 minutes or every hour.
• Daily Trading: For strategies that operate on a daily timeframe, trading decisions
can be made once per day, typically before the market opens or at a specific
time during market hours. This allows for analyzing data overnight and making
informed trading decisions for the day ahead.
59
• Longer Timeframes: If the trading strategy is based on longer timeframes,
such as swing trading or position trading, trading decisions can be made less
frequently. This can involve analyzing data and making trading decisions on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
It is important to align the frequency of data updates and trading decisions with
the capabilities of the trading bot, the availability of reliable data sources, and
the desired level of activity. Regularly review and adjust the frequency based on
the performance and effectiveness of the trading bot.

Assistant Message:
Solution: Determining the risk tolerance and position sizing strategy for the trading bot is
crucial to manage risk effectively. Here are some considerations to determine the risk tolerance
and position sizing strategy:
1. Risk Tolerance:
• Personal Risk Profile: Assess your personal risk tolerance as a stock trader.
Consider factors such as your financial situation, investment goals, time horizon,
and comfort level with potential losses. This will help determine the overall risk
tolerance for the trading bot.
• Maximum Acceptable Loss: Define the maximum acceptable loss per trade
or per day that aligns with your risk tolerance. This can be expressed as
a percentage of the trading capital or a fixed monetary amount. Setting a
maximum acceptable loss helps limit potential losses and manage risk.
• Risk-Reward Ratio: Determine the desired risk-reward ratio for the trading bot.
This ratio represents the potential reward (profit) relative to the risk (loss) for
each trade. A higher risk-reward ratio indicates a willingness to take on more
risk for potentially higher returns.
• Position Sizing Strategy:
• Fixed Dollar Amount: Allocate a fixed dollar amount per trade, regardless of
the stock’s price or volatility. This approach ensures consistent position sizing
and allows for better risk management. For example, you may decide to allocate
$1,000 per trade.
• Percentage of Trading Capital: Allocate a percentage of the trading capital per
trade. This approach adjusts the position size based on the available capital and
allows for flexibility. For example, you may decide to allocate 2% of the trading
capital per trade.
• Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Adjust the position size based on the volatility
of the stock or the market. This approach considers the risk associated with
each trade and adjusts the position size accordingly. For example, you may
allocate a larger position size for less volatile stocks and a smaller position size
for highly volatile stocks.
• Kelly Criterion: Utilize the Kelly Criterion formula to determine the optimal
position size based on the expected return and the probability of success. This
approach aims to maximize long-term growth while considering the risk of ruin.
It requires estimating the probability of success and the expected return for each
trade.
Consider combining risk tolerance and position sizing strategies to create a
comprehensive risk management approach. Regularly review and adjust the risk
tolerance and position sizing strategy based on the performance of the trading
bot and changes in market conditions.

agents are not required to cooperate on the task by instruction-following, which makes cooperation
among agents less controllable.
We apply a similar approach as the one adopted in Section where we ask GPT4 to assess the quality of
two presented solutions. In particular, we present GPT4 with the solution obtained using the original
inception prompt vs the ablated one. The scores are summarized in Table 9. Note that the selected set
of tasks are the same as those used in Section .
This emphasizes the significance of employing well-designed inception prompts and fostering
instruction-following cooperation among agents, as they play a crucial role in enabling agents to
generate superior solutions for their assigned tasks.

AI Society Ablated vs Original Prompt: Sample Task
AI Society (AI Assistant: Physical Therapist & AI User: Filmmaker)
Task:
Design individual exercise and conditioning plans to train the actors in violent fight sequences
tailored to the specific physical requirements and movements to be executed. Conduct regular
monitoring and modify programs when required.
Ablated Extracted Solution:
To ensure the safety and success of the actors during the filming of the fight sequences, I will
collaborate closely with the physical therapist. First, I will reach out to the fight choreographer
to get detailed information about the specific movements and techniques required for each
sequence. Once I have that information, I will begin designing individual exercise and
conditioning plans for each actor.
Throughout the project, regular communication will be key to our success. I will keep
the physical therapist updated on my progress, and we will schedule regular check-ins to
monitor the actors’ progress and make any necessary modifications to their programs. This
collaboration and support will help us work together to ensure the success of the project.
By staying in touch and keeping each other updated on our progress, we will work together
to make sure that the actors are well-prepared and that the fight sequences are executed
68
safely and effectively. With our combined expertise, we can design effective exercise and
conditioning plans that will help the actors perform the fight sequences safely and effectively.
Original Extracted Solution:
To assess the physical abilities and limitations of each actor, I will conduct a comprehensive
physical evaluation that includes a medical history review, musculoskeletal assessment, and
functional movement screening. Based on the results of these assessments, I will develop
individualized exercise and conditioning plans that address each actor’s specific physical
needs and limitations.
For actors who have identified muscle imbalances or weaknesses, I will include exercises that
target those specific areas. For actors who have limited range of motion or flexibility, I will
include exercises that focus on improving mobility and flexibility. I will also include exercises
that improve cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance.
To incorporate exercises that simulate the movements and physical demands of the violent
fight sequences, I will first analyze the specific physical requirements and movements to be
executed in the fight sequences. Based on this analysis, I will design exercises that mimic the
movements and physical demands of the fight sequences.
To develop a schedule for the actors’ exercise and conditioning plans, I will first consider the
availability of the actors and the filming schedule. Based on this information, I will work with
the production team to create a schedule that allows the actors to complete their exercise and
conditioning plans while also accommodating their filming schedule.
To provide the actors with proper warm-up and cool-down routines, I will design routines
that are tailored to their specific physical needs and the demands of the fight sequences.
The warm-up routine will include exercises that increase heart rate, blood flow, and body
temperature, as well as dynamic stretching to prepare the muscles for the upcoming activity.
The cool-down routine will include exercises that help the body recover from the physical
activity and reduce the risk of injury.
To educate the actors on proper nutrition and hydration, I will provide them with information
on how to fuel their bodies for optimal performance during the fight sequences. I will explain
the importance of consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods
such as lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables. I will
also provide them with guidelines on how much water they should be drinking each day, as
well as how to properly hydrate before, during, and after their workouts.
To provide the actors with guidance on how to properly rest and recover between fight
sequences, I will emphasize the importance of rest and recovery in the training process. I
will explain the importance of getting adequate sleep, as this is when the body repairs and
recovers from the physical demands of the fight sequences. I will also provide them with
information on active recovery techniques such as foam rolling, stretching, and low-intensity
cardio to help reduce muscle soreness and aid in recovery.
To provide the actors with guidelines on how to maintain their physical conditioning after
filming is complete, I will emphasize the importance of continuing to exercise and maintain a
healthy lifestyle. I will encourage the actors to continue to follow a balanced diet and stay
hydrated, as well as to continue to exercise regularly to maintain their cardiovascular and
muscular endurance. I will provide them with information on how to modify their exercise
and conditioning plans to fit their post-filming schedule and lifestyle, and encourage them to
find activities that they enjoy and that will help them stay active.
Review:
Assistant 1 provided a more comprehensive and detailed answer, covering various aspects of
the exercise and conditioning plans, including assessments, exercise design, scheduling, warmup and cool-down routines, nutrition, hydration, rest, recovery, and post-filming maintenance.
69
The answer was well-structured and addressed the specific requirements of the question.
Assistant 2’s answer was less detailed and focused more on communication and collaboration
with the physical therapist, which was not the main focus of the question. While Assistant 2’s
answer was relevant, it lacked the depth and detail provided by Assistant 1.

Model Exploration. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular technique for compressing complex
models into smaller, more practical models that can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios
without sacrificing performance [45]. KD aims to transfer knowledge from a larger, complex "teacher"
model to a more manageable "student" model, while maintaining the accuracy and generalization
capabilities of the original model. The knowledge transferred from the teacher to the student
model can be categorized into three main types: Response-based, Feature-based, and Relation-based
knowledge, which have been studied in various works [7, 45, 95, 58, 127, 60, 44, 17, 88, 87]. Recent
works have proposed innovative methods for extracting training data from both large language
models [14] diffusion models [15]. Those approaches could be seen as a means of training data
distillation, in which the model training data space could be extracted. The idea is to capitalize on the
models’ memorization of certain samples obtained from the internet. The process involves multiple
generations being created from the model, which is then sorted by specific metrics, and duplicate
generations are subsequently removed. The resulting generations are then scrutinized for any matches
that already exist on the web. If the generated samples match existing samples found on the internet, it
can be inferred that the model has been trained on those samples. Our work presents a novel approach
to the "mind exploration" of conversational agents. By enabling these agents to communicate and
collaborate in solving tasks, we gain insight into their actions and behaviors within a task-solving
context. Our mind exploration approach revealed several intriguing insights and challenges that are
yet to be further explored by the research community.
